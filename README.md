# Hangman

This is a Python version of the word-guessing game Hangman, which is more than 100 years old (but before computers were invented people had to play using pen and pencil).

Here is a link to a video showing how the game works. The video also shows the Python version in action, and demonstrates the first steps in writing your own version of the game:

This Python project has been designed to be built up using the website Trinket [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) so you should make sure you have a Trinket account before you start this project. If you have an email address you can open a new account at [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) by clicking on the button labelled Sign Up.

These instructions start from a Trinket project called *Hangman_starter* which you can find at

[https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/df98f23340](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/df98f23340)

You should Remix this project, then save it in your account and rename it, so you can work on your own version.

Now, get started coding your own version of *Hangman*.
